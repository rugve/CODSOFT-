This is the repository that contains the projetcs that i have developed .

Project 1: Image captioning  = The code defines a complex image captioning model using Hugging Face Transformers. It uses a class-based structure for better organization, encapsulating image preprocessing, caption generation, and error handling. The model predicts captions for input images based on a pre-trained checkpoint. The example usage demonstrates loading the model and generating captions for a specific image.

Project 2 : Simple Recommendation System = The code is a movie recommendation system that considers multiple movie genres and users. It uses TF-IDF vectorization to measure genre similarity and recommends movies for each user based on their liked movies. The system also identifies the most recommended genre and top movie title for each user. The code is flexible and can be adapted for different scenarios involving movie recommendations. 

Project 3 : FACE DETECTION & RECOGNITION = This process involves using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and scikit-learn for face detection and recognition. A pre-trained face detection model is employed, and MobileNetV2 is used to process images for recognition purposes. The similarity between a specific target face and those in a designated database is determined using cosine similarity. The approach extends to include functions for detecting faces in videos and recognizing faces within static images.
